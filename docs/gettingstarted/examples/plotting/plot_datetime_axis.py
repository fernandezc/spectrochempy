# Let's read on of the dataset (in `spg` Omnnic format)

# %%
dataset = scp.NDDataset.read_omnic(datadir / "irdata" / "nh4y-activation.spg")

# %% [markdown]
# We can have a pretty print of the dataset using the `print_`method. Note that in a
# jupyter notebook you just need to write
#  ```dataset```
# and an output in a html format will be issued.

# %%
scp.print_(dataset)

# %% [markdown]
# This dataset is actually to dimensional: one dimension (x) is the wavenumber axis (in $cm^1$ units),
# the second one is the acquisition datetime axis. The intensity is in a dimensionless
# units: absorbance.

# %% [markdown]
# By default it is plotted with the stack method

# %%
_ = dataset.plot(figsize=(6, 4))

# %% [markdown]
# Previously plotted as a stack plot, this dataset can also be plotted
# using a contour plot (method: map)

# %%
_ = dataset.plot_map(figsize=(6, 4))

# %% [markdown]
# As you see, spectrochempy does not display the datetimes on the vertical axis,
# because in this case the interval betwwen the date is relatively small. So it s displayed in seconds, with the starting reference noted on the aixs label.

# %% [markdown]
# Let's see another display of the datetime, that is in colorbar:

# %%
_ = dataset.plot(figsize=(6, 4), colorbar=True, colormap="magma")

# %% [markdown]
# It is also displayed on 1D sections:

# %%
section = dataset[:, 3200.0]
_ = section.plot(figsize=(6, 3), c="red", lw=3)

# %% [markdown]
# ## How to change the time units?

# %% [markdown]
# It may be desirable to change the default units on the datetime axis, *e.g.,* from seconds to hours in the above example.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Solution 1.
# The first solution, if we don't need to keep reference to the reference date, it to transform them in timedelta values:

# %%
newdataset = (
    dataset.copy()
)  # we copy it as we will need the original dataset for solution 2
newdataset.y -= newdataset.y[0]
scp.print_(newdataset.y)

# %% [markdown]
# This way we have subtracted the first value of the y axis array to all other values. The values are now in units of seconds. To change this in hours for instance, just do this:

# %%
newdataset.y.ito("hours")
scp.print_(newdataset.y)

# %% [markdown]
# And now the result is:

# %%
_ = newdataset.plot_map(figsize=(6, 4))

# %% [markdown]
# ### Solution 2.
#
# Another solution is to pass the keword parameters `time_units` in the plot command. This time_units must be a string among : ["days", "hours", "minute", "second", "millisecond", "microsecond", "nanosecond"]

# %%
_ = dataset.plot_map(figsize=(6, 4), time_units="minutes")

# %%
_ = section.plot(figsize=(6, 3), time_units="hours", c="red", lw=3)
