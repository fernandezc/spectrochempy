Import / Export to netCDF and xarray
====================================
In this example we show how to import/export netCDF files.

"""
# %%
# `NetCDF`_ (Network Common Data Form)
# is a file format designed to support the creation,
# access and sharing of scientific data. It is widely used among the oceanographic and
# atmospheric communities to store variables, such as temperature, pressure, wind speed,
# and wave height.
#
# Less known and used in the chemistry community,
# it is not lacking of interest to store data and structure of NDDataset
# in Spectrochempy.
#
# `NetCDF`_ data are :
#
# * self-describing, meaning that a netCDF file includes information about the data it
#   contains, such as when the data elements were captured and what units of
#   measurement were used;
# * portable, or cross-platform, in the sense that a netCDF file created on one type
#   of operating system can often be read by software on another type of operating
#   system;
# * scalable, in the sense that it is possible to efficiently access a small part
#   of a large netCDF file without having to read the whole file.
#
# In SpectroChemPy we do not use yet all the features, but saving and reading such
# data is possible. This for instance makes easy the exchange of data between
# `xarray`_ and SpectroChemPy.

# %%
# .. warning:
#
#   This example works only if the xarray package is installed.
#   If it is not the case, do it using conda, or pip.

# %%
# Let's start this example by reading some Infrared spectroscopic data.
import spectrochempy as scp

datadir = scp.preferences.datadir
nd = scp.NDDataset.read_omnic(datadir / "irdata" / "nh4y-activation.spg")
nd

# %%
# To export a dataset to the netCDF format, simply use the `write_netcdf` method.
# Pass a filename where to save (generally with the extension *.nc and with the
# confirm=False argument in order to avoid opening a dialog if the file already exists.
# The function return the full path of the created file.
f = nd.write_netcdf("netcdf_example.nc", confirm=False)

# %%
# To read the file, and create a new dataset from it:
othernd = scp.read_netcdf(f)
othernd

# %%
# we can check that the newly created dataset from the netCDF file is equivalent to
# the original one
assert othernd == nd

# %%
# Now we can test the opening of SpectroChemPy netCDF files by xarray
import xarray as xr

xrd = xr.open_dataarray(f)

# %%
# xrd is a
# `xarray.DataArray <https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.html#xarray.DataArray>`_
# object.
xrd

# %%
# It can be used as usually by xarray.
_ = xrd.plot()

# %%
xrd["y"] = (xrd.y - xrd.y[0]).astype(float) / 1.0e9  # base unit being in nanosecond
xrd.y.attrs["title"] = "time / s"
xrd.x.attrs["title"] = "wavenumber / cm^-1"
xrd.plot()

# %%
# scp.show()  # uncomment to show plot if needed (not necessary in jupyter notebook)
